# An-Analytical-Study-of-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Bengali-Sentiment-Analysis

This study aims to systematically evaluate and compare the performance of various
deep learning models in the context of Bengali sentiment analysis and consider the
performance of well-known sentiment analysis models on Bengali text in various
contexts, including news articles, social media, and user-generated content. It considers
factors like slang, regional differences, and subtleties in sentiment expression to
determine the advantages and disadvantages of each model within the unique language
and cultural framework of Bengali. The study also looks at the potential transferability of
information from models trained on multiple languages and investigates the effect of
using pre-trained language models on Bengali sentiment analysis. The ultimate
objective is to provide insights that can direct the creation of sentiment analysis models
that are optimized and especially suited for Bengali, tackling the language's particular
difficulties.
